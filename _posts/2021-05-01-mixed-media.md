The Mixed Media podcast starts passionate discussions about art and culture through live-streamed podcast episodes. My two co-hosts and I talk about interesting takes in the video game, music, and film worlds. Guest hosts sometimes join as well to offer their own takes on their art form. The goal: to create dialogue strong in voice but open in character because behind every lively medium must be lively discussion.
