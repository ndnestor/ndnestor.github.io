If you want a highly performant OS these days you are stuck with three options: MacOS, Windows, and Linux. The latter two are my favorite. Windows has great software compatibility and Linux is highly customizable. The idea of Project Winux is to create a library that allows users to override Windows' default GUI and make deep customizations that are not normally possible. This perfectly retains the aforementioned software compatibility of Windows while bringing the customizability of Linux to the table. Don't like the Start menu? Change the way it looks and functions. Don't like the Notification Center? Remove it. Want something more robust than Notepad? Replace it. Project Winux is the successor of [Active Overlay](https://github.com/ndnestor/Active-Overlay).
