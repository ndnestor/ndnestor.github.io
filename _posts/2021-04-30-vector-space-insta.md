Vector Space is the alias that I use when I post my 3D modeling work online. Currently I post them on Instagram (@vector.space.official). I use social media as a means to recieve feedback, get inspired by other artists, and motive myself to become more proficient in visual arts. I intend on uploading my work to Art Station as well in the future.
