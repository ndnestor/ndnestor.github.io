Day by Day is the current video game that I am working on with members of the Rutgers Creator of Games Society. I am taking on the role of the programmer as well as the musical composer. It is through this game that I intend on delivering my first completed video game project. As well, this is my debut as a composer as I am using Day by Day as an introduction to the art of composition.
