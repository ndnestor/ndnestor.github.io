subtitle: A smart eye strain reducer

This program reduces the end-user's eye strain by modulating their screen's brightness based on what is currently present on their screen. The brighter the pixels are on average, the lower the brightness setting of the end-user's screen will get. This is mainly a solution for laptops as desktop monitors usually cannot have their brightness setting be modulated programmitcally. Laptops, on the other hand, almost always support software-based brightness modulation.
