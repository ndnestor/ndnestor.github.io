subtitle: News for video game developers

Game State is a YouTube video series that I started intended to deliver video game developers news about events in the video game industry. Every 2-3 weeks I would post a video talking about all of that video game developers ought to know happened in the recent past. Unfortunately, this series has been stopped indefinitely as I no longer have the recording equipment required to make it happen.
